## Security Levels Overview

The IEC 62443 series defines four Security Levels (SL):
- **SL 1**: Protection against casual or coincidental violation
- **SL 2**: Protection against intentional violation using simple means
- **SL 3**: Protection against intentional violation using sophisticated means
- **SL 4**: Protection against intentional violation using state-of-the-art means

## Key Relationships

- **Parts 1-2** provide foundational concepts and management frameworks
- **Part 3** addresses system-level security requirements and risk assessment
- **Part 4** focuses on component-level security requirements and development practices
- All parts work together to provide a comprehensive cybersecurity framework for industrial automation and control systems
